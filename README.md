Spine-cython
============

Implementation of the [Esoteric Software Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) 
**version 2** runtime library in [Cython](http://cython.org/) and 
[Python](https://www.python.org/). 

Library is working on Python2.7, but it isn't tested yet with Python3. 
For examples and how to create renderer check
